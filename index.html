            <p>Third generation programming started in the late 1950's, it was so big because it was the first
                generation that was high leveled. Making it more programmer friendly by making the machine more
                independent by improving support for data types, and making programming expressions that favors the
                programmer and not the computer.</p>

            <h1>Birth of modern day programming</h1>
            <p>To pick up where we left off; 3GL or Third Generation Programming, was the first step toward programmmer
                friendly software.Things like Fortran, COBOL, & ALGOL are examples of early 3GL software. Later software
                developed would be Java, Python, C++, C#, etc. Most 3GL languages support structured programming.</p>
